```
## Project Structure
### Implementation
The Reports Service is a Java Spring Application. It is split into two major layers:

- Controller - This contains the end-point from where the transformation is invoked
- Transformation Layer - This contains transformations from the Bundle Encounter Report to the two XML reports. Java classes for the XML model are deployed as a [bintray artifact](http://bintray.com/ems-test-harness).

There is also a service layer for miscellaneous services required for the transformations.

There are also packages for:

- Utilities
- Configuration (For the spring, security and fhir server)
- Logging

### Tests
One component test is provided as well as unit tests for each of the transformations.
